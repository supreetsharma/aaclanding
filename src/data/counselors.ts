    bio: "I am a Registered Social Worker in British Columbia and Ontario. I obtained my Masters of Social Work at the University of Victoria. I have worked in the social service sector for over 5 years in different capacities working with individuals, families and groups. With my experience in the anti-violence sector, mental health, corrections, substance use, and community work I approach my counselling practice through a trauma-informed, decolonial and strengths based lens. I understand that healing is not linear and I hope to help you discover new coping skills and support you as you navigate difficult challenges in your life.\n\nMy work is centred around supporting individuals who are seeking change and are looking to heal experiences in their life that have impacted them. I focus on supporting individuals with where they are at and provide a safe space to explore their healing.",
